# diffusion-model-for-landscapes

This repository contains a diffusion model trained on landscape data (LHQ1024_jpg). The model uses latents from pre-trained VAE (stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-ema) to reduce size and manage training in a single GPU. It is implemented in Pytorch and FastAI.

The data can be found at https://github.com/universome/alis.

This model can be used to generate realistic landscape images. It is also a good starting point for experimenting with diffusion models and their applications.
